      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied for a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (EME) at the London School of Economics from 2019 - 2020. Prior to starting the Master&amp;rsquo;s, I knew from speaking with other students and professors that this Master&amp;rsquo;s had a reputation for being very technical, and that it would be an intense year. Indeed, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2024/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics&#34;&gt;LSE&amp;rsquo;s official page&lt;/a&gt; for the program reads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics is a technically rigorous programme designed to meet the needs of those who have a strong quantitative background wishing to study economics. It is aimed at mathematicians, statisticians, physical scientists and engineers, as well as graduate economists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

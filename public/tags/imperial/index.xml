      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied for a part-time Master’s in Applied Mathematics at Imperial from October 2021 to October 2023, while continuing to work at 80% capacity at the Bank of England. In this blog, I’ll write about my personal experience studying this Master’s part-time. I hope this is useful for prospective part-time students - I know that when I was applying, I struggled to find anyone’s personal experiences and would have found it useful to hear about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

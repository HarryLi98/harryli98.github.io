[{"content":"The 30th EuroChess took place between May 9th and 10th, 2025 in Budapest, Hungary. EuroChess is an annual tournament for European central banks. This year, the tournament was organized by the Hungarian National Bank\u0026rsquo;s Sports Club and was hosted at ibis Budapest City.\nI participated in the tournament representing the Bank of England (BoE) along with my colleague Harley Mason. The tournament was attended by 18 central banks from across Europe. The Bank of England had not participated in the tournament since 2002, so the other players were pleasantly surprised to see us there. We were warmly welcomed by the organizers and other participants. The organisers welcomed us with gifts of signed copies of Judit Polgár\u0026rsquo;s books, which were highly appreciated. We also got to meet Judit later on when she visited the tournament, which was a very memorable experience.\nLeft to right: Harley Mason (BoE), Zoran Stanic (EIB), Demet Tamam (EIB), Judit Polgár, Harry Li (BoE).\nRapid Tournament On Friday 9th May, there was a team rapid chess tournament with a time control of 15 minutes plus 5 seconds per move. The rapid tournament featured a total of 18 teams of central banks, each consisting of 4-6 players, competing in an individual Swiss system format over 8 rounds. The sum of the top four scoring players from each team determined the team\u0026rsquo;s score. Since we were only two players, we merged with the European Investment Bank (EIB) team, which also had only two players; Zoran Stanic and Demet Tamam. This was a great opportunity for us to meet new people and make new friends. Throughout the rapid tournament, there was a restriction that each player could not be paired against another player from the same team. The tournament was played in a friendly atmosphere, with a mix of experienced and novice players.\nThe BoE and EIB team started strong, scoring 10/12 points in the first three rounds, putting us in first position. However, we were unable to maintain our lead and finished the tournament in 9th place with a total of 17/32 points. The tournament was won by the National Bank of Belgium, who scored 22/32 points, narrowly beating Banque de France on tie-break points.\nMy personal performance started well, winning the first four rounds. In round five, I lost to the eventual tournament winner after declining a draw offer and over-pressing a slightly better endgame. Then, I was unable to bounce back and scored only 2 points in the last three rounds, finishing with a total of 6/8 points.\nTable of individual results from the BoE \u0026amp; EIB Team:\nFinal Rank Seed No. Name Classical Rating Points 7 1 Harry Li 2247 6/8 10 9 Zoran Stanic 2073 5/8 49 72 Harley Mason 0 4/8 86 92 Demet Tamam 0 2/8 Congratulations to the National Bank of Belgium for winning the tournament and to Dirk Michiels from Belgium for winning the best individual prize with 6.5/8 points.\nThe full tournament results can be found on chess-results. The tournament was not FIDE rated.\nBlitz Tournament On the morning of Saturday 10th May, there was an individual blitz tournament with a time control of 5 minutes plus 3 seconds per move. The blitz tournament had 57 players and was an individual Swiss system format over 11 rounds.\nI managed to win the tournament on tie-break with a score of 8.5/11 points. I started strongly, scoring 6.5/7 points in the first seven rounds. I then lost two games in a row unnecessarily by again over-pressing better positions. I was fortunate to win the last two rounds, which allowed me to catch the leader and tie for first place with Kornel Frindt from National Bank of Slovakia. Thanks to my good early performance, I had the better tie-break score, which allowed me to win the tournament.\nFinal Rank Seed No. Name Classical Rating Points 1 1 Harry Li 2247 8.5/11 47 43 Harley Mason 0 4.5/11 The full tournament results can be found on chess-results. The tournament was not FIDE rated.\nI won a trophy for winning the blitz tournament:\nJudit Polgár The highlight of the trip came after winning the Blitz tournament. The organisers had arranged for Judit Polgár to visit to give a lecture, followed by a simultaneous exhibition against the 18 central banks. Judit Polgár is widely regarded as the best female chess player of all time, and a former top 10 player in the world.\nJudit showed us one of her attacking games in the Sicilian Najdorf against Garry Kasparov from Linares 2001, which was very instructive. She then played a simultaneous exhibition against the 18 central banks. The central banks each nominated one player to make the moves, and were allowed to consult with each other during the game. I was nominated to make the moves for the BoE and EIB team, and I was very excited to play against Judit. We played a Scotch game, and I played a very solid line with the hope of making a draw. We followed a theoretical line that I knew, resulting in an equal endgame. However, Judit made a mistake and allowed us to win an important pawn, and we were able to convert the advantage into a win. I know from experience that giving simultaneous exhibitions is very tiring, and Judit was very gracious in accepting the loss. She congratulated us for being the strongest team. It was a great honour to play against her!\nConclusion Overall, the EuroChess 2025 tournament was a great experience. It was a pleasure to meet new people and make new friends. The tournament was well organized, and the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. I would like to thank the organizers for their hard work and dedication in making this event a success. Next year, the tournament will be co-hosted by the Deutsche Bundesbank and the European Central Bank held in Frankfurt, Germany. I look forward to participating in future EuroChess tournaments!\n","permalink":"https://harryli.netlify.app/post/chess/eurochess25/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe 30th EuroChess took place between May 9th and 10th, 2025 in Budapest, Hungary.

In this blog, I’ll write about my personal experience studying this Master’s part-time. I hope this is useful for prospective part-time students - I know that when I was applying, I struggled to find anyone’s personal experiences and would have found it useful to hear about.\nMotivation I had only recently graduated from a Master’s in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics from The London School of Economics in summer 2020, and doing another Master’s was the last thing on my mind. After my Master’s at LSE, I joined the Bank of England on the graduate scheme in September 2020. There, I learnt that the Bank encourages new graduates to en-roll in some part-time study program, which they support by providing some study leave. I’ve always enjoyed studying maths, and saw this as an opportunity to improve my technical skills. In particular, I wanted to learn more about partial differential equations and machine learning in order to apply these skills to solve problems in economics.\nI quickly settled on studying at Imperial as it has an excellent maths department, is based in London, and was one of the only universities which offered part-time study. The admissions requirements mentioned needing a 2:1 degree in mathematics, physics or engineering, which I didn’t have (although I had studied a fair amount of Maths at LSE). Still, I applied and thankfully they accepted my application - they just asked for evidence that I obtained a distinction in my Master’s at LSE.\nI must admit I was initially apprehensive about enrolling for this Master’s. Some of my friends studied maths at Imperial and warned me that the workload was intense. I worried that I would struggle to understand lectures as I didn’t have an undergraduate degree in maths. The part-time Master’s at Imperial is also different to other part-time Master’s that were offered at the Bank. These other part-time Master’s degrees typically had classes online on one dedicated day a week, and you could study in your own time - typically requiring a commitment of about 6 hours a week. This part-time Master’s at Imperial is different because it’s like a normal full-time Master’s, except you study half the number of modules each year. The disadvantage in this is that you will likely have lectures or classes on multiple days of the week, and you still need to commute to campus for these. I wasn’t sure if I would be able to juggle this part-time Master’s while still working a full-time job - in particular I was apprehensive about the workload and also the logistics in commuting between work, home and the office. I ended up commuting between campus and the office during my lunch breaks, staying on campus for the morning or afternoon if I had any lectures or classes. Thankfully I am able to work flexible hours and remotely, which really helped me. The time commitment is also much more - requiring around 22 hours per week (6 hours of contact time per term, and 16 hours for problem sets, coursework, revision, and working on the thesis).\nThere was also the issue of COVID. Imperial adopted a hybrid teaching style for my first year, which meant that lectures were pre-recorded to be watched on-line in your own time, and classes were hybrid, meaning that you could attend in-person or dial-in on Teams. The way it worked was that lecturers released weekly recordings, which were to be watched before the classes. All of the modules used the same lecture recordings they made during the 2020 academic year. I must admit it felt a bit like learning from YouTube. Some lecture recordings were low quality, as they re-used recordings from pre-COVID where the white board the lecturer was writing on was barely visible. Often, the lecturer and class teacher were different, with the lecturer not being available for the term, making it more difficult to ask questions.\nStructure of the Master’s Modules To complete the Masters, we had to study eight modules and complete the Applied Mathematics Research Project (thesis). These eight modules could be freely chosen from a list of modules from the Applied Mathematics options list. This list is quite extensive and covers a wide range of topics in applied mathematics, including applied and stochastic analysis, analytical methods, numerical analysis and scientific computation, fluid dynamics, mathematical physics, bio-mathematics, data and optimisation methods, and more. Students also have some flexibility to choose up to two modules from outside this list, subject to approval from the course director. Modules from Pure Mathematics could be chosen without any need for approval. There were also a few modules that you could choose from the Statistics or Computer Science departments, but these would need approval from the course director.\nAlmost all of these modules are also offered to third year undergraduate students or students on the final year of the integrated Masters (MSci). For each module, there is also a Mastery component to be completed by only 4th year students or Master’s students. The Mastery component is an additional question in the exam worth 20% of the grade. The material is often an extra chapter in a textbook, to be self-taught be the student. I found it difficult to study for the mastery section for each module, since you had to learn the material yourself and come up with your own practice questions, as you couldn’t rely on past papers (the mastery topic often changes every year).\nOverall, the modules count towards two thirds of your final grade. The remaining one third is from the Applied Mathematics Research Project.\nApplied Mathematics Research Project The Applied Mathematics Research Project is a substantial research project, where you work alongside your supervisor and work on some state-of-the-art problems in applied mathematics. Professors in the Maths department collate a list of interesting research projects, and this is sent to students around December. Students need to choose a research topic that they find interesting from this list, and then contact professors individually to get them accepted as supervisors. This is done on a first-come-first-serve basis, so you are not guaranteed to get to work on the research topic you find most interesting. For example, every year there are usually a small number of research projects on data-science, but these are highly demanded and disappear very quickly.\nScoring well in the research project is very important, because it counts for one third of your degree, and if you want a distinction overall, you need to get an average grade of 70+ across all modules and the research project, and the grade for the research project has to be a distinction.\nWork-life balance \u0026amp; social life The guidelines for the Master’s states that the indicative total study time is 2250 hours over the entire MSc programme (including the summer), this being composed of roughly 1500 hours associated with modules and 750 hours with the research project.\nLet’s do some basic math:\nFor a part-time student, this equates to 1125 hours per year, which assuming you study 51 weeks a year (generously taking one week off in the year for special occasions like Christmas, New Year etc.), equates to approximately studying on average for 22 hours per week, over two years. Then, assuming you work at 80% capacity at a standard 9am-5pm job, this means you work around 28 hours per week for your job. Combining work and study, this means you need to average around 50 hours per week between work and study. And this does not include things like commute time, which can easily add more hours to the week (I was regularly commuting for two hours to attend a one hour lecture…).\nMy social life decreased quite a lot during this Master’s too. As a part-time student, I also felt that it’s more difficult to make friends on the Master’s program naturally, because I didn’t have time to attend any social events, and after lectures, I had to get back to normal work, so I didn’t have time to socialise with my peers. There was a significant opportunity cost in doing the Master’s. I had to sacrifice attending a lot of social events, and I also didn’t have time to go on holiday over the two years. I used almost all of my annual leave allowance to give myself extra time to do assessed courseworks and to revise for the exams. The workload at Imperial was intense, and I spent most of my life over these two years juggling work and studies. I enjoy studying maths and I feel like I learnt a lot, so it was worth it, but if you are thinking of doing this Masters part-time, keep in mind that it is a significant time commitment.\nMy Modules As a part-time student, I had to study two modules per term. Since I had an economics background, I was not really interested in mathematical physics or biology, which narrowed down the list of modules I was interested in studying. Still, there was enough options for me to study eight modules that I found interesting. One important thing when choosing modules was to note the asssesment format for each module. A small number of modules are assessed as 100% coursework, whereas others are exam based, typically assessed as 10% coursework and 90% exam. These 100% coursework modules are completed during the term. The benefit of choosing coursework modules is that you don’t need to do an exam. However, they can be extremely time consuming, so I strongly recommend that you do not to choose more than one coursework module per term.\nI’ll talk a bit about my experience studying for each of my modules.\nTheory of Partial Differential Equations Lecturer: Michele Coti Zelati (pre-recorded lectures), Michele Dolce\nComing from a non-maths background, I found this course quite challenging. Almost all of the content was new to me and I didn’t have some prerequisite knowledge such as advanced Calculus that would have surely been helpful. Still, it was a useful course for me to get introduced to partial differential equations. We studied common partial differential equations such as first order equations, the diffusion equation, the wave equation and the Laplace equation. The reference textbook for this module was Salsa (2016).\nFinal Score: 89.29\nDynamics of Learning and Iterated Games Lecturer: Sebastian van Strien\nNo prior knowledge was really needed for this module. Despite having studied game theory quite extensively in economics, a lot of the content in this module was new to me, as it focussed more on evolutionary game theory, which is an application of game theory to evolving populations in biology. Evolutionary game theory differs from classical game theory as it focusses more on the dynamics of strategy change.\nFinal Score: 72.55\nMethods for Data Science Lecturers: Mauricio Barahona, Barbara Bravi\nPersonally I really enjoyed how this module integrated machine learning theory with its implementation in Python. We covered all the classical machine learning methods like Ridge and Lasso regression, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, but also deep neural networks and its implementation in TensorFlow. This module was fully coursework assessed. In our coursework, we had to implement common Machine Learning methods from scratch in Python, such as Random Forests and Feed-forward Neural Networks, which gave me a deeper understanding of how these methods work. There were two pieces of coursework for this module and they took me a very long time to complete - about a week each when working on it full-time (I took two weeks holiday from my job in order to complete these courseworks).\nThe Maths in this module was not that difficult and didn’t need much prior knowledge.\nFinal Score: 94.72\nIntroduction to Statistical Learning Lecturers: Guy Nason (pre-recorded lectures), Elena Hernández-Hernández\nThis module focussed more on the theory behind machine learning, whereas the Methods for Data Science module covered some theory, but focussed more on the implementation. I felt that this module was a useful complement to the Methods for Data Science module, as I got a better theoretical understanding of the machine learning methods work. The maths in this module was also not that difficult and didn’t need much prior knowledge.\nFinal Score: 78.31\nFunction Spaces and Applications Lecturer: Pierre Germain\nI studied this module because I was interested in functional analysis, and also because it was a prerequisite for studying another module - Advanced Topics in Partial Differential Equations. We covered Banach spaces and compactness in Banach spaces, \\(C^{k}\\) spaces, \\(L^{p}\\) spaces and continuous linear maps in \\(L^{p}\\) and finally Hilbert Spaces. I’ve always really enjoy Analysis, so I found this module fun! Pierre also explained things very well. My only criticism with this module was that there were no lecture notes, which made revising more difficult. I used (Sasane 2017) as a reference book when revising, which I found very helpful.\nFinal Score: 71.80\nAdvanced Topics in Partial Differential Equations Lecturer: Anna Kostianko\nThis module was a complete nightmare for me! We had a new lecturer and new syllabus which didn’t follow any reference textbook. The closest textbook we could use was Brezis (2010), but this was too difficult for me to understand. The only pre-requisite course for this module was Function Spaces and Applications, but I think having some knowledge of Partial Differential Equations was also helpful. Still, this module used results from Functional Analysis that were not covered in Function Spaces and Applications, so I struggled with the content.\nInitially we also didn’t have any lecture notes, problem sets or problem set solutions, which only came later on. This module also differed from other modules in that we had three hours of lectures every week, without any problem solving classes. This meant that there was so much content to learn, without any chance to practice it - and each lecture required knowledge from previous lectures, which made it just impossible to follow, particularly since we didn’t have any notes. Most of us were trying to copy the lecturer’s scribbles on the white board during the lecture. Eventually we were given some handwritten notes, which I tried transcribing into LaTeX for the class, which can be found on my GitHub page. It was much more time consuming to transcribe the notes than I imagined (especially trying to already balance all my studies with a full-time job…), so I didn’t manage to transcribe all the lectures. Still, I think I did a good job transcribing almost 30 pages of notes, and hope that someone finds my transcribed notes useful. On the plus side, I learnt a lot about how to write notes in LaTeX efficiently, and I will share my guidance in a future blog!\nContent-wise, it really felt like this was an Advanced Functional Analysis class rather than Partial Differential Equations. We covered the theory of distributions, Sobolev spaces, and properties for linear elliptic, linear evolutionary and semilinear parabolic equations, such as methods for proving the existence and uniqueness of solutions, a priori estimates, and properties of solutions.\nI really thought I would fail this module despite putting in a lot of effort. Thankfully the final exam was easy and similar to the problem sets, so I was able to score well.\nFinal Score: 90.46\nMathematical Finance: An Introduction to Option Pricing Lecturer: Pietro Siorpaes\nThis was an interesting module that focussed on the intuition of option pricing. The whole content is presented in a mathematically friendly way, which limited the amount of prerequisite knowledge required. The models were presented in discrete time, so we didn’t need knowledge of stochastic calculus or measure theory. Initially I was disappointed in this, since I had already studied stochastic calculus and measure theory at LSE, which I enjoyed, but it probably was a good idea to simplify the maths and focus more on the intuition of Option Pricing. Overall, I felt that the content wasn’t that difficult and I enjoyed studying this module, although the final exam was ridiculously difficult!\nFinal Score: 79.00\nOptimisation Lecturer: Dante Kalise\nThis module was straightforward. To be honest I chose this module because I thought it would be easy (and it was), so I would have more time to focus on my thesis. This module focussed on optimisation for differentiable functions, using methods like gradient descent. The mastery material was on Optimal Control, which was new to me and I found that interesting.\nFinal Score: 80.63\nApplied Mathematics Research Project Supervisors: Professor Grigorios A. Pavliotis, Dr. Anastasia Borovykh\nInitially I had difficulty finding a suitable research topic. The list of research projects are comprised of topics that the professors at Imperial are interested in working on, and as a result, I found that they were lots of topics on mathematical physics and biology, but there were no topics on mathematics applied to economics. Given this, I felt that there were very few projects that I was interested in. The project that looked most interesting to me was on “Time-optimal control of agent-based dynamics” by Professor Dante Kalise and Professor Grigorios A. Pavliotis, which would have studied the synthesis of control laws for agent-based models arising in large animal populations and swarm robotics. However, this was taken almost immediately (I contacted Professor Kalise on the day the list of research projects was released and he said it was already assigned to another student…). I ended up explaining my situation with Professor Pavliotis, stating my interest in maths applied to economics, and he said he was also interested in this, and we ended up working on my thesis on “Stochastic Differential Equation Models for Systemic Risk”. Later in Summer 2022, Dr. Borovykh joined as my secondary supervisor.\nI started working on my project from Spring Term in 2022, initially doing literature reviews and thinking about what models I would develop. I would meet my supervisor fortnightly and update them on research papers that I read and any modelling updates I had. Professor Pavliotis would give me useful guidance on which papers to read and what directions to look further in. During exam period around May, I would shift my focus to revision, and then during Summer, I would focus on the research project again. As a part-time student, I had two summers to complete the thesis, which was definitely helpful (although I was back to 100% capacity in my normal job over summer). Some points of reflection I have are:\nIt’s better to work on the project consistently from the start, rather than short bursts. You’ll ponder more about the project naturally, giving you more time to find breakthrough ideas. You’ll probably stress less too since you’ve kept up working on it. Take notes during your literature reviews. I usually downloaded the research papers and annotated them. Take notes each time you meet with your supervisor. Note down what you discussed, and what the next steps are. I kept a OneNote for all my meetings, and found it useful to go back and read. It takes a really long time to write up the thesis! I completed most of my analysis a month before starting to write up the thesis, and spent almost a month writing up everything. I’m not a great writer, so I spent lots of time on: thinking about how to structure my thesis how to explain topics that I know (harder than I imagined) formatting charts formatting diagrams (I wanted high-quality diagrams so learnt TikZ) formatting math Also when writing up my thesis, I realised that I had some gaps in my analysis, which I had to go back and fill. Overall my thesis was about 20,000 words. We also had to design a research poster for a summer research fair. Although this wasn’t assessed, it was fun to do this and see what other people in my cohort were working on.\nYou can download my thesis and research poster from my website here.\nFinal Score: 90.00, Excellent MSc Applied Mathematics Project Prize\nGraduation Graduation for me took place in May 2024, which was around nine months after graduating in October 2023. The nice thing about Imperial’s graduation is that it’s convened in the Royal Albert Hall! It was really amazing to graduate in such an iconic building. I got really lucky with the weather too as it was sunny.\nGraduation photo at The Albert Memorial! 😊\nFinal thoughts The Master’s was very time consuming and combining part-time studying with a full-time job was really challenging. I am fortunate that I had no other real responsibilities in life and could dedicate myself to focussing on work and study for two years, so it was just about manageable. My employer was also helpful as they allowed me to work flexible hours, which really helped so I could attend lectures during the day. Given how much effort I put in, it was rewarding to complete the Master’s with distinction and also to win prizes for my research project, and to graduate in the Royal Albert Hall.\nIf you have any comments, or found this blog useful, please comment below!

The Reykjavík Open is an annual chess tournament that takes places in Reykjavík, Iceland. The first edition was held in 1964, and since its inception, it has attracted top players such as the 8th world chess champion Mikhail Tal, and among the current top players, five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen, Fabiano Caruana, Wesley So, Anish Giri, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, and many more.\nThis was the first international chess competition that I played in in almost 10 years. The last time I competed internationally was when I represented England in the Under 16s section of the World Youth Chess Championship in Durban, South Africa in 2014. I\u0026rsquo;ve always enjoyed competing internationally since you get to meet and play against people from all over the world, and this tournament was no exception.\nParticipants For this tournament, there were around 400 entrants from 49 different countries. The Reykjavík Open usually attracts some of the best chess players in the world, including many grandmasters (abbreviated GM) and international masters (abbreviated IM). This year, the top seed for the tournament was GM Bogdan-Daniel Deac, a 22 year old chess grandmaster from Romania, who is currently rank number two nationally and rank 44 in the world. The number two seed was the legendary GM Vasyl Ivanchuk from Ukraine, who has won the world rapid and blitz championships and was former world number two in classical chess (only behind renown former world chess champion GM Garry Kasparov). At the opening party, I gathered the courage to challenge Ivanchuk to two blitz games, and managed to draw them both - a very memorable experience. Let me know in the comments section if you want to see the games!\nThis year\u0026rsquo;s Reykjavík Open also had generous women\u0026rsquo;s prizes, which attracted some of the top women players to compete. Six of top 50 women\u0026rsquo;s players participated. The top women\u0026rsquo;s seed was the 21-year old GM Zhu Jiner from China. Other top women players included IM Nurgyul Salimova (best woman chess player in Bulgaria, who will be competing in the FIDE Candidates tournament in April 2024 - an eight-player chess tournament, held to determine the challenger for the World Chess Championship 2024), IM Gunay Mammadzada (best woman chess player in Azerbaijan), IM Teodora Injac (best women chess player in Serbia) and renown chess commentator IM Tania Sachdev from India.\nAdditionally, there were nine well-known chess content creators participating, who live-streamed each of their games to large audiences on Twitch and YouTube, as well as posting recap videos of their games to YouTube. These streamers were Anna Cramling, Alexandra and Andrea Botez, Dina Belenkaya, Zachary Saine, Alexandra Prado, Anna-Maja Kazarian and Tallulah Roberts. This drastically increased the publicity of the tournament, with tens of thousands of viewers watching these live-streams and hundreds of thousands of viewers watching daily recap videos of their games.\nComing into this tournament, my rating was 2107 and I was seeded number 107. I had no expectations for doing well, but just wished to play some good chess. It was a pleasure to play in a tournament featuring such top players! You can find the full list of participants here.\nVenue The tournament was held in the Harpa Concert Hall in Reykjavík, Iceland. In my opinion, this was the best venue I have ever played a tournament in. The concert hall is beautifully designed and located by the sea, with a clear view of Iceland\u0026rsquo;s mountains.\nThe tournament hall was located inside the concert hall on the ground floor. It was spacious and we had a nice view of the sea while playing.\nThere was a \u0026ldquo;streamer\u0026rsquo;s corner\u0026rdquo; where the chess content creators live-streamed their games to Twitch and YouTube, with online commentary to tens of thousands of viewers. The streamer\u0026rsquo;s and the top players also play on DGT boards, which broadcast the moves online to chess.com and lichess.org for the chess world to follow (with a 15 minute delay for anti-cheating measures).\nOther nice things about the venue/organisation were that they had a reception where you could leave your bags or mobile phone, and also the tournament was sponsored by an Icelandic water company so you could get free bottled water while playing. They also gave out nice pens to record your moves, so you didn\u0026rsquo;t need to bring anything to the game - ideal for forgetful chess players!\nIceland Iceland was very cold! I was warned that Icelandic weather is unpredictable, but actually it was fairly predictable if your expectations are cold, windy, with rain/snow.\nOn the second day of the tournament, a volcano erupted prematurely which triggered a state of emergency in southern Iceland. Fortunately, the eruption was far from Reykjavík and didn\u0026rsquo;t affect our tournament in any way. I was still playing round 3 when this happened, and did not realise there was volcano activity until I walked home and saw that the sky was red.\nAccommodation I travelled with two friends and we stayed in a really nice AirBnB about 30 minutes walk from the playing venue. This worked out cheaper than staying in the official hotels, and our AirBnB flat was really great with a large communal area, and even had a piano which I could practice on. Also I feel that forcing myself to walk for at least an hour every day was a good thing.\nTouristy stuff During the tournament, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have much time to explore Iceland. However, we stayed an extra day after the tournament. We decided not to do the famous golden circle tours, which in retrospect was good since one of the main attractions - the Blue Lagoon - closed due to the volcano eruption. Instead, we went to Sky Lagoon - a geothermal spa near Reykjavík which was nice. We also hiked back home through the countryside.\nFood I discovered that Iceland is a very expensive country. We usually bought lunch from Krónan - a supermarket on the way to the venue. For dinner, we would usually eat out. My favourite place was Icelandic Street Food, which offered lamb meat soup or spicy tomato soup with bread, with unlimited refills (of soup and bread), and free waffles. Fantastic value for money, especially for Iceland!\nChess Finally onto the tournament itself.\nThe tournament is a swiss-system with nine rounds, with accelerated pairings. The time control was 90 minutes for 40 moves, after which players get an additional 30 minutes, including a 30 second increment per move from move one. The accelerated pairings meant that the pairings in the first half of the tournament would be extra difficult for me!\nRound 1 In round one, I faced Turkish grandmaster GM Emre Can - rated 2551 and seeded number nine in the tournament. I had some chances from the opening but misplayed and eventually lost.\nMe struggling in round 1 - photo taken by Hallfríður Sigurðardóttir\nRounds 2 and 3 Day two was a double-round day. Round two started at 9am. I had black against a lower rated English opponent (rated 1894) and managed to win a complicated game after about five hours of play.\nIn round three, I had white against a lower rated opponent from Norway (rated 1945). He played a similar opening to my game against Emre Can in round 1, so I was better prepared. Nevertheless, I forgot what to do after 10 moves and ended up in an equal position after the opening. Luckily, I managed to outplay him in time trouble and after more than five hours of play, I managed to win to move to 2/3 points (I think we were both exhausted at the end - I had played more than 10 hours of chess that day).\nRound 4 In round four, I faced Icelandic Grandmaster GM Johann Hjartarson, rated 2460. However, his peak rating was 2640 and according to his Wikipedia page, he was the highest-rated Icelandic player from July 1991 to March 2015. I tried surprising my opponent in the opening by playing the Archangel Defence of the Ruy Lopez (deviating from what I usually play). While the opening wasn\u0026rsquo;t a disaster, I confused my preparation and went badly wrong shortly after the opening and got checkmated quickly.\nRounds 5 and 6 Day four was another double-round day. In round 5, I had white against a lower rated opponent from Germany (rated 1906). Funnily enough, he played the same opening - the accelerated dragon - as my games in rounds 1 and 3. Surely then, I must have been fully prepared in the opening right?? Wrong. I planned to review my analysis of this particular opening line on my phone on the walk to the venue, but forgot to transfer my analysis from my laptop to my phone\u0026hellip; Again, I was not better from the opening, but I think that I managed to play well after that and outplayed my opponent and won.\nIn round 6, I had black against a lower rated opponent from Sweden (rated 1780). However, he was clearly underrated and my opening preparation failed me again\u0026hellip; Nevertheless, I found an interesting idea involving a piece sacrifice on move 17 (mainly out of desperation) and managed to win a nice attacking game to move to 4/6 points.\nRound 7 In round 7, I was paired against IM Benjamin Haldorsen from Norway, rated 2423. He surprised me in the opening by playing the Caro-Kann - something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen him play before. Given this, I decided to deviate on move three from what I normally do by playing the advance variation. I think we were both on our own from move 8, and I ended up worse shortly after the opening. Fortunately, he made some uncharacteristic mistakes and I got a very nice position. He was in some time trouble and blundered on move 27 and I found a nice knight sacrifice that gave me a completely winning position, and I won shortly after without much trouble and moved onto 5/7.\nRound 8 In round 8, I had black against IM Alexander Katz from the USA, rated 2418. He won the blitz tournament with 9/9 earlier on in the event, ahead of other grandmasters, so I assumed he was underrated. He played a Spanish opening and I decided to deviate from my round 3 game by playing the Marshall defense. I got a decent position from the opening, but misunderstood the resulting isolated queen\u0026rsquo;s pawn position and got crushed with some nice tactics from my opponent.\nRound 9 In the final round, I had white against a lower rated opponent from India (rated 1831). Despite being lower rated, I noticed that he had some good results in previous rounds, and generally I find that Indian players are underrated, so I still took this game seriously. I managed to land most of my opening preparation (perhaps the only time in this tournament) to reach a pleasant endgame, and my opponent got into time trouble and played several inaccurate moves that allowed me to win without much trouble.\nLet me know in the comments section if you want me to annotate more of my games, and I will make a separate blog post!\nResult Overall, I finished with 6/9 points, finishing in 45th place. I also gained +32.4 rating points. I\u0026rsquo;m pleased with this result as the competition was very strong and I feel like I played some good chess. I also won a rating prize - second place for players rated between 2001 and 2200, and was awarded €150.

Prior to starting the Master\u0026rsquo;s, I knew from speaking with other students and professors that this Master\u0026rsquo;s had a reputation for being very technical, and that it would be an intense year. Indeed, LSE\u0026rsquo;s official page for the program reads\nThe MSc Econometrics and Mathematical Economics is a technically rigorous programme designed to meet the needs of those who have a strong quantitative background wishing to study economics. It is aimed at mathematicians, statisticians, physical scientists and engineers, as well as graduate economists.\nThe technical level of the material covered is perhaps higher than for any other master\u0026rsquo;s degree in the area, and the programme has a long-standing international reputation, with many distinguished economists and econometricians among its graduates.\nI find it funny that the program is described as being primarily aimed for those with a quantitative background, and not necessarily economics! In my cohort (of around 40 people), we had students with undergraduate degrees in maths, engineering, computer science, management, but the majority of students still had studied economics.\nI had an economics background, having studied my bachelors in economics from the London School of Economics. In my undergraduate degree, I studied as much maths as possible, which helped prepare me for the advanced level of the degree. In particular, in the third year of my undergraduate degree, I took a module on Econometric Theory (EC309) which covered a lot of similar material as in the Master\u0026rsquo;s. The content for this module was roughly equivalent to the taught material from the first year of a well-respected PhD program in Economics. Needless to say, this was far too difficult for me as an undergrad, and I did badly in my final exam, but it did well to prepare me for the advanced level of the econometrics module in EME.\nIntroductory course The Master\u0026rsquo;s started in August with a three week introductory course, where we covered the essential foundations for Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Econometrics, spending one week on each discipline. The first lecture for Microeconomics was a review of real analysis; properties of open and closed sets, limits, and continuous functions, topics that we never saw again in the subsequent Microeconomics modules. The schedule for the first three weeks was intense, with lectures and problem sets every day. We had a test at the end of the three weeks, and if you scored below 60 in two of the three modules, they recommended that you transfer to the MSc in Economics, which a few students did.\nIn general I would say that these first three weeks were more difficult than the rest of the year, so scoring badly in these exams is not necessarily an indicator of your ability to do well in the rest of the year. However, many students still transferred as they also had to apply for jobs or PhDs during the term, which would make catching up on top of the intense workload more difficult.\nModules For EME, there are three compulsory modules in Econometric Analysis, Advanced Microeconomics, Advanced Macroeconomics. Additionally, students can take an \u0026lsquo;outside\u0026rsquo; option, which could either be from the economics department, or statistics, mathematics or finance. Popular fields were Contracts and Organisations, Further Econometric Theory, Labour. For my outside option, I chose two half-modules on Stochastic Processes and Stochastic Analysis.\nEconometric Analysis The first half of this module was mostly on probability theory. We studied techniques for convergence in probability, distribution and other modes of convergence, deriving convergence rates, proving various central limit theorems and time-series analysis. Prior knowledge of real analysis, probability theory and measure theory were useful here.\nThe second half covered proofs of the general consistency and asymptotic normality theorems for extremum estimators (Newey \u0026amp; McFadden, 1994), and their application to non-linear least squares, maximum-likelihood and generalised method of moment estimators. We also covered topics like quantile regression, non-parametric methods and bootstrapping.\nOverall, I found the module manageable, but was helped by having covered a lot of the material from the first term as an undergrad.\nAdvanced Macroeconomics This module introduced us to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models (DSGE). We studied how to derive analytical solutions to simple DSGE models, and how they were applied to study consumption, asset pricing, investment, business cycles, unemployment, fiscal and monetary policies. We also studied representative and heterogeneous-agent growth models like the Bewley-Aiyagari-Hugget model, and the policy implications of using heterogeneous-agent models.\nAdvanced Microeconomics We covered general equilibrium theory and models of bargaining and competition in the first half of the module, and decision making under uncertainty, auctions and moral hazard in the second half.\nThis module was quite easy, and we never had to apply most of the esoteric theorems we learnt in the introductory course.\nStochastic Processes This was a nice half-module that gave an introduction to stochastic processes. The main topics were Martingales, Poisson Processes, Brownian motion, stochastic differential equations and diffusion processes, with applications to finance. Having prior knowledge of measure theory was useful.\nStochastic Analysis Stochastic analysis was much harder than stochastic processes! This was one of the most difficult modules I studied in my four years at LSE. The module covered (long) proofs of the existence of Brownian motion and its properties. Then we rigorously covered Ito\u0026rsquo;s formula, the Ito integral and strong and weak solutions to stochastic differential equations. Prior knowledge of stochastic processes, measure theory, functional analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs) were useful for this course. Unfortunately, I never studied PDEs or functional analysis, which may be why I struggled!\nSocial Life Most students would study for most of their waking time, so the social life during EME wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best. Nevertheless, as a relatively small cohort taking the majority of classes together, you can become close together, bonding through mutual suffering. On some Friday nights, we would go for a late-night pizza after studying all day in 32 Lincoln\u0026rsquo;s Inn Fields. The department also organises some events during Christmas and Easter, which are good for meeting students from other programs. I was active in LSE\u0026rsquo;s chess society and had friends there from undergraduate with whom I could play blitz with, which gave me some welcome breaks from studying.\nStudent satisfaction My general impression was that at LSE, the Economics department did not really care much about you, and the culture was sink or swim. If you were struggling to cope, the course director would recommend that you switch to the MSc in Economics to have an easier life. At LSE, you were randomly assigned a personal tutor. These personal tutors were either faculty or PhD students from the economics department. I was assigned to a new assistant professor. I only met with them once at the start of the academic year, and they were unable to help me with anything as they were totally new. They never reached out again after that initial meeting, and I felt that I was unable to go to them for help, so it was not a useful relationship. There was also an MSc Tutor with whom you could book appointments to talk about anything, typically PhD applications. These were typically fully booked so I also never managed to speak to them.\nOn the academic front, I felt largely on my own during this Masters. The quality of teaching varied quite a bit. Some lecturers provided nice lecture notes, problem sets and solutions, while others provided nothing. You could attend office hours, but some professors or teaching assistants were really not that helpful in explaining concepts. However, some of them were great, and I\u0026rsquo;m very grateful for their help!\nRecommendation I\u0026rsquo;d recommend doing EME if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in economics research, and are interested in doing a PhD. The MSc in EME has the best international reputation for any non-US degree, and has good placements. Students from my cohort were admitted into PhD programs at top universities such as Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Cornell and LSE. However, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important to realise that doing well in EME doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically guarantee you a place at a top PhD program. This is because there is no research element in EME. Many people initially struggled to be admitted, and spent 1-2 years working as a research assistant before being successful in their applications.\nGraduation photo!

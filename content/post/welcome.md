Welcome to my personal website! I'll write blogs ad hoc. on my academic interests (primarily mathematics, economics, programming and machine learning), personal interests, and to share some of my life experiences.

I'm trying to practice becoming a better writer, and thought that starting a blog could help me articulate my thoughts better, and allow me to share my interests with you.

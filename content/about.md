I'm a model developer at the Bank of England. 

I joined the Bank of England in 2020 after completing my Master's in [Econometrics and Mathematical Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2023/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) from the London School of Economics. Additionally, I studied part-time for a Master's in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/applied-mathematics/) at Imperial College London (2021 - 2023).

My academic interests are at the intersection of mathematics, economics and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in applications of deep learning to solve economic models.

I'm a keen chess player and play for Chessable White Rose in first division of the [Four Nations Chess League](https://www.4ncl.co.uk/faq.htm). I've previously been a member of the England Junior Chess Team and I represented England in the Under 16 World Youth Chess Championships in Durban, South Africa in 2014.

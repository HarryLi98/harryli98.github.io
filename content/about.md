I'm a model developer at the Bank of England.


I have a Master's in [Econometrics and Mathematical Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2023/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics) from the London School of Economics and am studying part-time for a Master's in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/applied-mathematics/) at Imperial College London.

My interests are at the intersection of mathematics, economics and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in the application of deep reinforcement learning to solve economic models. 

I'm also a keen chess player and play for Chessable White Rose in first division of the [Four Nations Chess League](https://www.4ncl.co.uk/). I've previously been a member of the England Junior Chess Team and I represented England in the Under 16 World Youth Chess Championships in Durban, South Africa in 2014.

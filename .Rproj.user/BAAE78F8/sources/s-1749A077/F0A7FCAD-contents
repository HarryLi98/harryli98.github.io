# Introduction
I studied for a Master's in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (EME) at the London School of Economics from 2019 - 2020. I knew this Master's had a reputation for being very mathematical, and that it would be an intense year. Prior to this, I graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics from the London School of Economics. In my undergraduate degree, I studied as much math as possible, which helped prepare me for the advanced level of the degree. In particular, in the third year of my undergraduate degree, I took a module on Econometric Theory (EC309) which covered a lot of similar material as in the Master's. The content for this module was roughly equivalent to the taught material from the first year of a well-respected PhD program in Economics. Needless to say, this was far too difficult for me as an undergrad, and I did badly in my final exam, but it did well to prepare me for the advanced level of the econometrics module in EME.

# Introductory course
The Master's started in August with a three week introductory course, where we covered the essential foundations for Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Econometrics, spending one week on each discipline. The first lecture for Microeconomics was a review of real analysis; properties of open and closed sets, limits, and continuous functions, topics that we never saw again in the subsequent Microeconomics modules. The schedule for the first three weeks was intense, with lectures and problem sets every day. We had a test at the end of the three weeks, and if you scored below 60 in two of the three modules, they recommended that you transfer to the MSc in Economics, which a few students did. 

In general I would say that these first three weeks were more difficult than the rest of the year, so scoring badly in these exams is not necessarily an indicator of your ability to do well in the rest of the year. However, many students still transferred as they also had to apply for jobs or PhDs during the term, which would make catching up on top of the intense workload more difficult.

# Modules
For EME, there are three compulsory modules in Econometric Analysis, Advanced Microeconomics, Advanced Macroeconomics. Additionally, students can take an 'outside' option, which could either be from the economics department, or statistics, mathematics or finance. Popular fields were Contracts and Organisations, Further Econometric Theory, Labour. For my outside option, I chose two half-modules on Stochastic Processes and Stochastic Analysis.

## Econometric Analysis
The first half of this module was mostly on probability theory. We studied techniques for convergence in probability, distribution and other modes of convergence, deriving convergence rates, proving various central limit theorems and time-series analysis. Prior knowledge of real analysis, probability theory and measure theory were useful here.

The second half covered proofs of the general consistency and asymptotic normality theorems for extremum estimators ([Newey & McFadden, 1994](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~xshi/econ715/chap36neweymacfadden.pdf)), and their application to non-linear least squares, maximum-likelihood and generalised method of moment estimators. We also covered topics like quantile regression, non-parametric methods and bootstrapping.

Overall, I found the module manageable, but was helped by having covered a lot of the material from the first term as an undergrad.

## Advanced Macroeconomics
This module introduced us to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models (DSGE). We studied how to derive analytical solutions to simple DSGE models, and how they were applied to study consumption, asset pricing, investment, business cycles, unemployment, fiscal and monetary policies. We also studied representative and heterogeneous-agent growth models like the [Bewley-Aiyagari-Hugget model](https://benjaminmoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lecture3_EC442_Moll.pdf), and the policy implications of using heterogeneous-agent models.

## Advanced Microeconomics
We covered general equilibrium theory and models of bargaining and competition in the first half of the module, and decision making under uncertainty, auctions and moral hazard in the second half.

This module was the easiest, and we never had to apply most of the theorems we learnt in the introductory course.

## Stochastic Processes
This was a nice half-module that gave an introduction to stochastic processes. The main topics were Martingales, Poisson Processes, Brownian motion, stochastic differential equations and diffusion processes, with applications to finance. Having prior knowledge of measure theory was useful.

## Stochastic Analysis
Stochastic analysis was much harder than stochastic processes! This was one of the most difficult modules I studied in my four years at LSE. The module covered (long) proofs of the existence of Brownian motion and its properties. Then we rigorously covered Ito's formula, the Ito integral and strong and weak solutions to stochastic differential equations. Prior knowledge of stochastic processes, measure theory, functional analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs) were useful for this course. Unfortunately, I never studied PDEs or functional analysis, which may be why I struggled!

# Recommendation
I'd recommend doing EME if you're interested in economics research, and are interested in doing a PhD. The MSc in EME has the best international reputation for any non-US degree, and has good placements. From my cohort, we had people get into PhD programs at top universities such as Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Cornell and LSE. However, I think it's important to realise that doing well in EME doesn't automatically guarantee you a place at a top PhD program. This is because there is no research element in EME. Many people initially struggled to be admitted, and spent 1-2 years working as a research assistant before being successful in their applications.
